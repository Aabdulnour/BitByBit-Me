BIG SPRINT 11

From MVP to “this feels like a real product”

High level goals
• Keep the current MVP behavior working and stable.
• Make the experience feel smooth for both students and teachers, with clear flows and fewer rough edges.
• Show a believable path to ML and avatar features, even if some pieces are “coming soon”.

1. Login and shell polish
User story
As a student or teacher, I want sign in to feel simple and intentional so I trust the app and know I am in the right mode.

Tasks
• Keep Student / Teacher toggle centered and each button at half width on the row.
• Add subtle hover and active styles so the selected mode is obvious.
• Keep forgot password minimal for now:
  • Small, quiet link under the main form
  • Basic placeholder view only, no deep logic required this sprint
• Make sure the shell navigation clearly separates:
  • Student view
  • Teacher view
  • No confusing links that jump between them

2. Full diagnostic review UX
User story
As a student, after I finish my unit diagnostic, I can review what I did without feeling like I have to retake it.

Backend
• Add an endpoint similar to:
  GET /api/student/:studentId/diagnostic-results/:unitId
• Behavior:
  • Returns has_attempt: false if no diagnostic attempt exists for that unit
  • Otherwise returns:
    • Quiz details for that diagnostic
    • For each question:
      • question text
      • options
      • student answer
      • correct answer
      • is_correct flag

Frontend
• On Units page:
  • If no diagnostic attempt: show “Take diagnostic”
  • Once a diagnostic attempt exists: show “Review diagnostic results”
  • Entry point goes to /diagnostic-results/:unitId
  • Do not offer a retake from this entry point
• Diagnostic results page:
  • Header with unit name and diagnostic score summary
  • List of questions with:
    • Question text
    • Student answer vs correct answer
    • Clear correctness chip
  • “Back to unit” button

3. Ready Player Me avatar flow
User story
As a student, I want to customize my avatar through a fun editor and see it across the app, without pasting URLs.

This sprint goal
Make the path clear and get the “coming soon” UX tight. Do only the minimum embed work you realistically have time for.

Tasks
• Profile page:
  • Keep current avatar section but:
    • Show a nice default avatar if no URL is set
    • Copy clearly states something like “Custom avatars powered by Ready Player Me are coming soon”
  • When avatar exists:
    • Show it large on Profile
    • Show a small circle preview on Home
  • (Stretch) Begin wiring Ready Player Me:
    • Add an “Open avatar editor” button that opens an iframe modal
    • Handle a simple postMessage with the final URL and store it
    • For now, this can target one hard coded RPM experience URL and a simple listener

4. Teacher dashboard analytics and UX polish
User story
As a teacher, I want to quickly understand where my class is struggling and drill into a student without fighting the UI.

Fixes
• Student detail panel:
  • Make the detail content scroll within the panel like described above
  • Ensure selection state is clear in the students list

Analytics
• At the top of teacher overview, show:
  • Total students
  • Average mastery for the class
  • Total attempts
  • Average hint usage
• For each unit:
  • Unit tile with:
    • Unit name
    • Average mastery
    • Attempt count
    • Hint usage rate
  • Make tiles visually consistent with student cards

Student detail view
• When clicking a student:
  • Fixed header with:
    • Student name
    • Overall mastery
    • Quick stats (attempts, last activity)
  • Scrollable body with:
    • Per unit mastery list
    • Table of recent attempts with:
      • Date
      • Quiz type (diagnostic, mini, practice, unit)
      • Score or result
      • Hint usage

5. General UX polish
• Consistent use of spacing, font sizes, and card styles across student and teacher views.
• Make loading states explicit where data fetches take more than a moment.
• Ensure all main flows work on a laptop sized screen without awkward scrolling.
